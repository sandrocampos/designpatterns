# Design Patterns in TypeScript

## Creational Patterns
- **[Abstract Factory]**: Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **[Builder]**: Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- **[Factory Method]**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **[Prototype]**: Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- **[Singleton]**: Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
 

## Structural Patterns
- **[Adapter]**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **[Bridge]**: Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
- **[Composite]**: Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- **[Decorator]**: Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- **[Facade]**: Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.


## Behavioral Patterns
- **[Command]**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.
- **[Interator]**: Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
- **[Observer]**: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
- **[Strategy]**: Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
